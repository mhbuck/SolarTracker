## Solar Tracker
Based on an instructable took an attempt at simplifying the code. I have not been able to test any of the code as no access to the database and unsure about any of the data types but took a best guess.

The Instructable is found here http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Tracker-in-the-Internet-Cloud/ 

Build using .Net 4.5 using WebApi and Dapper for data access.
